              adenylylmethylenediphosphate are 3?5-fold more effective than ATP
              as gorging stimulants for Aedes aegypti. This increased potency
              is not due to the fact that the two analogues are not hydrolysed
              by the mosquito salivary apyrase, but most likely to their
              greater affinity to the mosquito gustatory receptor protein. The
              analogues 2'd ATP and 3'd ATP are about half as potent as ATP,
              while 2?,3?-dideoxyadenosine triphosphate is 10-fold more potent
              than ATP in evoking the gorging response. It is proposed that
              removal of both hydroxyl groups eliminates binding of the
              stimulant at the ribose moiety, thus allowing the molecule
              greater freedom to rotate and bind more effectively to its two
              other binding sites at the amino group on the purine and at the
              terminal phosphate. Our data demonstrate that ATP activates the
              gorging response of Ae.aegypti merely by binding to its receptor
              protein and is not required as an exogenous source of energy.

              common indoors and earthenware jars the most common out doors.
              Breeding habitats for Ae. albopictus were commonly found in
              earthen ware jars, tin cans, ant traps, rubber tires, bowls, and

  abstract  = "Olfactory learning in blood-feeding insects, such as mosquitoes,
               could play an important role in host preference and disease
               transmission. However, standardised protocols allowing testing
               of their learning abilities are currently lacking, and how
               different olfactory stimuli are learned by these insects remains
               unknown. Using a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm, we trained
               individuals and groups of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to associate
               an odorant conditioned stimulus (CS) with a blood-reinforced
               thermal stimulus (unconditioned stimulus; US). Results showed,
               first, that mosquitoes could learn the association between
               L-lactic acid and the US, and retained the association for at
               least 24 h. Second, the success of olfactory conditioning was
               dependent upon the CS--some odorants that elicited indifferent
               responses in na{\"\i}ve mosquitoes, such as L-lactic acid and
               1-octen-3-ol, were readily learned, whereas others went from
               aversive to attractive after training (Z-3-hexen-1-ol) or were
               untrainable ($\beta$-myrcene and benzyl alcohol). Third, we
               examined whether mosquitoes' ability to learn could interfere
               with the action of the insect repellent DEET. Results
               demonstrated that pre-exposure and the presence of DEET in the
               CS reduced the aversive effects of DEET. Last, the nature of the
               formed memories was explored. Experiments using cold-shock
               treatments within the first 6 h post-training (for testing
               anaesthesia-resistant memory) and a protein synthesis inhibitor
               (cycloheximide; to disrupt the formation of long-term memory)
               both affected mosquitoes' performances. Together, these results
               show that learning is a crucial component in odour responses in
               A. aegypti, and provide the first evidence for the functional
               role of different memory traces in these responses.",

              recorded as the cubic value of wing length, was correlated with
              total protein, lipid, and carbohydrate reserves at eclosion.
              Protein and carbohydrate had a linear relationship, whereas
              lipids were positively allometric and sex-specific; per unit
              size, males had substantially higher lipid levels than females. A
              wide spectrum of imaginal body size resulted by varying larval
              rearing conditions (crowding, starvation, and optimal food
              supply), but regardless of treatment, teneral reserves conformed
              to regression equations related to body size. Therefore, larval
              food supply was of primary importance in determining imaginal
              body size and reserves. The minimal irreducible amounts of female
              reserve components were 69--86\% of the teneral protein, and
              16--46\% of teneral lipids; carbohydrates were mobilized nearly
              completely. The extent of reserve mobilization was dependent on
              the availability of drinking water. With free access to sucrose,
              maximal reserves were synthesized, dominated by tremendous
              lipogenesis and leading to a linear correlation of body size with
              total caloric reserves at the outset of the gonotrophic cycle.
              Blood consumption by large females was more than twice that of
              small females, but fecundity increased about 4-fold. The
              efficiency of blood meal utilization for yolk synthesis was
              proportional to body size. Large females revealed a threshold
              level in fecundity, below which maternal reserves were required
              for completion of o{\"o}genesis. The total caloric content per
              mature o{\"o}cyte however, was constant under all experimental
              conditions, with variations in the relative distribution of its
              protein and lipid, depending on maternal body size. In large
              females the gonotrophic cycle was completed in a significantly
              shorter period than in smaller ones that ingested blood of equal

  author   = "Packer, H L and Armitage, J P",
  abstract = "Rhodobacter sphaeroides exhibits two behavioral responses when
              exposed to some compounds: (i) a chemotactic response that
              results in accumulation and (ii) a sustained increase in swimming
              speed. This latter chemokinetic response occurs without any
              apparent long-term change in the size of the electrochemical
              proton gradient. The results presented here show that the
              chemokinetic response is separate from the chemotactic response,
              although some compounds can induce both responses. Compounds that
              caused only chemokinesis induced a sustained increase in the rate
              of flagellar rotation, but chemoeffectors which were also
              chemotactic caused an additional short-term change in both the
              stopping frequency and the duration of stops and runs. The
              response to a change in chemoattractant concentration was a
              transient increase in the stopping frequency when the
              concentration was reduced, with adaptation taking between 10 and
              60 s. There was also a decrease in the stopping frequency when
              the concentration was increased, but adaptation took up to 60
              min. The nature and duration of both the chemotactic and
              chemokinetic responses were concentration dependent. Weak organic
              acids elicited the strongest chemokinetic responses, and although
              many also caused chemotaxis, there were conditions under which
              chemokinesis occurred in the absence of chemotaxis. The
              transportable succinate analog malonate caused chemokinesis but
              not chemotaxis, as did acetate when added to a mutant able to
              transport but not grow on acetate. Chemokinesis also occurred
              after incubation with arsenate, conditions under which chemotaxis
              was lost, indicating that phosphorylation at some level may have
              a role in chemotaxis. Aspartate was the only chemoattractant
              amino acid to cause chemokinesis. Glutamate caused chemotaxis but
              not chemokinesis. These data suggest that (i) chemotaxis and
              chemokinesis are separate responses, (ii) metabolism is required
              for chemotaxis but not chemokinesis, (iii) a reduction in
              chemoattractant concentration may cause the major chemotactic
              signal, and (iv) a specific transport pathway(s) may be involved
              in chemokinetic signalling in R. sphaeroides.",

              challenged by empirical studies that highlight alternative
              movement patterns of animals, especially when foraging in
              resource-poor environments. Yet, empirical studies reveal animals
              moving in a Brownian fashion when resources are abundant. We
              demonstrate that Einstein's original theory of collision-induced
              Brownian motion in physics provides a parsimonious, mechanistic
              explanation for these observations. Here, Brownian motion results
              from frequent encounters between organisms in dense environments.
              In density-controlled experiments, movement patterns of mussels
              shifted from L{\'e}vy towards Brownian motion with increasing
              density. When the analysis was restricted to moves not truncated
              by encounters, this shift did not occur. Using a theoretical
              argument, we explain that any movement pattern approximates
              Brownian motion at high-resource densities, provided that
              movement is interrupted upon encounters. Hence, the observed
              shift to Brownian motion does not indicate a density-dependent
              change in movement strategy but rather results from frequent
              collisions. Our results emphasize the need for a more mechanistic
              use of Brownian motion in ecology, highlighting that especially
              in rich environments, Brownian motion emerges from ecological
              interactions, rather than being a default movement pattern.",

              actively searching predators. For ambush predators, habitat
              complexity may enhance or have no effect on predation rates
              because it conceals predators, reduces prey detection by
              predators, or visually impairs both predators and prey. We
              investigated the effects of habitat complexity and predation by
              the ambush predators Toxorhynchites rutilus and Corethrella
              appendiculata on their mosquito prey Aedes albopictus and
              Ochlerotatus triseriatus in container analogs of treeholes. As in

              food limitation. We used starvation resistance (number of days
              alive without food) as an indicator of the feeding history in
              third-instar Ae. aegypti larvae. Resistance to starvation and
              other measures of immature success, such as development time,
              survival, and adult mass, were investigated across a wide range
              of feeding conditions in the laboratory. Resistance to starvation
              of third-instar larvae and body mass of adults emerging from
              pupae collected in water-storage containers in an urban area were
              compared with the laboratory results. If resistance to starvation
              and adult mass of field-collected Ae. aegypti corresponded with
              the lower levels of feeding in the laboratory, then food
              limitation could be inferred in field-collected larvae. Results
              showed that resistance to starvation was well correlated with
              previous feeding levels and with the other measures of immature
              success. Both resistance to starvation and adult body mass of
              field-collected specimens corresponded with the lower levels of
              feeding in the laboratory. Therefore, it was concluded that food
              limitation or competition is likely to be a regulatory factor in
              water-storage containers in the urban area. It is recommended
              that any control measure applied to immature Ae. aegypti in
              water-storage containers should eliminate all or most of the
              individuals, otherwise unintended, undesirable results might

              Swiss lakes offer such habitats, several of which are inhabited
              by the leaf beetle Macroplea appendiculata (Panzer 1794). This
              donaciid beetle is the only coleopteran species known to complete
              its life cycle entirely under water, where it lives primarily on
              perfoliate pondweed (Potamogeton perfoliatus L.), with Eurasian
              watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) as an alternative host
              plant. Direct observations during diving trips, aquatic
              olfactometer bioassays, and stir bar sorptive extractions (SBSE)
              coupled with GC--MS analysis were used to understand how these
              beetles locate their patchily distributed host plants and
              congeners in a harsh, often swirling environment. In olfactometer
              assays we observed that the aquatic beetle is strongly attracted
              to water extracts of pondweed, whereas neither mature males nor
              females beetles seem to produce attractive cues. The chemical
              analyses revealed that perfoliate pondweed releases one
              dominating compound, eucalyptol. Olfactometer assays confirmed
              that this is a potent attractant for the beetle. We also observed
              attraction to phytol, which is released by the main, as well as
              the alternative host plant. These finding are somewhat surprising
              as eucalyptol has never been reported for aquatic plants and
              phytol is poorly soluble in water. In addition, both are
              frequently described as insect repellents in terrestrial
              ecosystems. We suggest that these terpenoids normally have a
              defensive function against herbivores and pathogens, but that the
              highly specialized leaf beetle has evolved to exploit its host's
              defence chemistry for optimal foraging.",

               successive movement steps that have uniformly random directions
               and lengths drawn from a probability distribution that is
               heavy-tailed. This idea has generated a huge amount of interest,
               with numerous studies providing empirical evidence in support of
               the hypothesis and others criticising some of the methods
               employed in these. The most common method for identifying
               L{\'e}vy walk behaviour in movement data is to fit a set of
               candidate distributions to the observed step lengths using
               maximum likelihood methods. Commonly used candidate
               distributions are the exponential distribution and the power-law
               (Pareto) distribution, both on an infinite and a finite
               (truncated) range. Data sets for which the relative fit of a
               power-law distribution is better than that of an exponential are
               typically classified as L{\'e}vy walks. However, the movement
               pattern of the L{\'e}vy walk is similar to that of an animal
               that switches between two behavioural modes in a composite
               correlated random walk (CCRW) movement process. Recent studies
               have shown that standard approaches can misidentify the CCRW
               process as a Levy walk. This misidentification can be due to the
               methods used to sample and process the data, a failure to assess
               the absolute fit of the candidate distributions, or the lack of
               a strong alternative model. In this chapter, we simulate a CCRW
               process and show that including a composite exponential
               distribution in the set of candidate distributions can alleviate
               the problem of misidentification. However, in some cases
               sampling and processing of the CCRW data can cause a power-law
               distribution to have a better fit than a composite exponential.
               In such cases, the absolute goodness-of-fit of the power-law
               distribution is typically poor, indicating that none of the
               candidate distributions are a good model for the data. We
               discuss the relevance of these results for the analysis of
               empirical movement data.",

               (Corvus brachyrhynchos) to urbanization by (1) comparing rates
               of winter population change between urban and nonurban locations
               (using standard Christmas Bird Counts); (2) quantifying
               population size along a gradient of urbanization in western
               Washington; and (3) pooling studies from eastern (New York),
               midwestern (Wisconsin), and western North America (Washington
               and California) relating survivorship, reproduction, and space
               use to urbanization. American Crow populations tend to be
               densest and increasing most rapidly in urban areas of North
               America. This appears to be facilitated by small space neEDS of
               crows in urban relative to suburban, rural, and exurban areas.
               Crow survivorship is high across the urban gradient, but
               reproduction and hence population growth, peaks in suburban and
               rural settings. Local demographic considerations appear unable
               to account for changing winter crow populations. Rather, we
               hypothesize that urban crow populations may be increasing
               primarily as surplus crows from suburban and rural areas
               disperse into the city where anthropogenic food sources are
               easily located, rich, and concentrated. This hypothesis likely
               is affected by local crow sociality. In the western United
               States, where pre-breeders often form flocks able to exploit
               urban riches, our dispersal hypothesis may be accurate. But, in
               midwestern and eastern areas, where crows migrate south for
               winter or remain on territories to help rather than float as
               pre-breeders, dispersal may not be adequate to fuel urban
               population growth. Refuse, invertebrates, and small vertebrates
               appeared to be more common food items than the nest contents of
               other birds. This, and the typically diverse suite of nest
               predators in any area, may explain why the rate of predation on
               artificial nests we placed throughout the urban gradient was not
               highly correlated with the abundance of crows. We encourage
               researchers to study how urbanization affects important
               mechanisms (like nest predators and predation) so environmental
               policy will benefit from a detailed, scientific understanding of
               how avian communities are structured.",

              availability of food (plant infusions and microbes) and suitable
              conditions (the presence of conspecifics), repellents and
              deterrents show the risk of predation, infection with pathogens,
              or strong competition. Many studies have addressed the question
              of which substances can act as positive or negative cues in
              different mosquito species, with sometimes apparently
              contradicting results. These studies often differ in species,
              substance concentration, and other experimental details, making
              it difficult to compare the results. In this review, we compiled
              the available information for a wide range of species and
              substances, with particular attention to cues originating from
              larval food, immature stages, predators, and to synthetic
              compounds. We note that the effect of many substances differs
              between species, and that many substances have been tested in few
              species only, revealing that the information is scattered across
              species, substances, and experimental conditions.",

              dispersals, and the risks associated with contemporary movements.
              We surveyed mitochondrial DNA of Black Rats collected across
              their global range as a first step towards obtaining an
              historical genetic perspective on this socioeconomically
              important group of rodents. We found a strong phylogeographic
              pattern with well-differentiated lineages of Black Rats native to
              South Asia, the Himalayan region, southern Indochina, and
              northern Indochina to East Asia, and a diversification that
              probably commenced in the early Middle Pleistocene. We also
              identified two other currently recognised species of Rattus as

              unlined with paper toweling, the presence of paper increased

              their trajectory through space and the distribution of stimuli in
              the environment. This is particularly apparent for mosquitoes,
              which use a combination of olfactory, visual, and thermal cues to
              locate hosts. Mosquitoes are thought to detect suitable hosts by
              the presence of a sparse CO₂ plume, which they track by surging
              upwind and casting crosswind. Upon approach, local cues such as
              heat and skin volatiles help them identify a landing site. Recent
              evidence suggests that thermal attraction is gated by the
              presence of CO₂, although this conclusion was based experiments
              in which the actual flight trajectories of the animals were
              unknown and visual cues were not studied. Using a
              three-dimensional tracking system, we show that rather than
              gating heat sensing, the detection of CO₂ actually activates a
              strong attraction to visual features. This visual reflex guides
              the mosquitoes to potential hosts where they are close enough to
              detect thermal cues. By experimentally decoupling the olfactory,
              visual, and thermal cues, we show that the motor reactions to
              these stimuli are independently controlled. Given that humans
              become visible to mosquitoes at a distance of 5-15 m, visual cues
              play a critical intermediate role in host localization by
              coupling long-range plume tracking to behaviors that require
              short-range cues. Rather than direct neural coupling, the
              separate sensory-motor reflexes are linked as a result of the
              interaction between the animal's reactions and the spatial

              non-associative learning widely studied in vertebrates and
              invertebrates. Habituation was defined as the progressive and
              reversible decrease in response to a reiterative stimulus. We
              first aimed at confirming habituation of the escape response in
              mosquito larvae (4th instar). Then, we determined whether a
              mnesic trace was established. Larvae were individually stimulated

              analogous to sniffing in vertebrates. Combining computer-vision
              algorithms with reconstructed olfactory environments, we
              establish that larvae orient in odour gradients through a
              sequential organization of stereotypical behaviours, including
              runs, stops, lateral head casts and directed turns. Negative
              gradients, integrated during runs, control the timing of turns.
              Positive gradients detected through high-amplitude head casts
              determine the direction of individual turns. By genetically
              manipulating the peripheral olfactory circuit, we examine how
              orientation adapts to losses and gains of function in olfactory
              input. Our findings suggest that larval chemotaxis represents an
              intermediate navigation strategy between the biased random walks
              of Escherichia Coli and the stereo-olfaction observed in rats and
              humans.",

               The predictions were: 1) A. triseriatus from sites where the
               predator Toxorhynchites rutilus is abundant vs rare differ in
               types of activities and positions occupied, or the degree to
               which they change behavior in the presence of T. rutilus; 2)
               Some activities or positions entail greater risks of predation
               than others; 3) High-risk behaviors are more common among larvae
               from sites where T. rutilus is rare vs sites where T. rutilus is
               common. Behavior was quantified by direct observation of
               individual larvae with T. rutilus present or absent. Riskiness
               of behaviors was quantified by recording the frequency with
               which different behaviors led to capture. Populations from
               Normal, IL (T. rutilus very rare) and Vero Beach, FL (T. rutilus
               common) differ in patterns of activity and position occupied,
               confirming prediction 1). Changes in behavior in the presence of
               T. rutilus did not differ between populations. Thrashing was the
               most- and resting the least-risky activity; the bottom was the
               most- and the surface the least-risky position, confirming

               Vero Beach (high-predation population), confirming prediction
               3). For both populations, earlier instars spent more time
               thrashing and less time at the surface than did later instars.
               Activity and position were correlated: larvae at the surface
               rarely thrashed and frequently filtered. Fixed interpopulation
               behavioral differences seem to be the proximate causes of
               differences in vulnerability to predation. Changes in behavior
               in response to the presence of T. rutilus were minor and did not

  abstract = "Our species have altered their surroundings since its early
              dispersion on Earth. Unfortunately, thanks to human-modified
              habitats, several pest organisms such as domiciliary insects have
              expanded their distributions. Moreover, pest-related
              microorganisms may also be aided by anthropization. Pest
              cockroaches are globally distributed and capable of carrying
              several diseases. We explored if urbanization may buffer
              environmental conditions allowing pest insects to expand their
              distribution. Specifically, we suggest that human settlements may
              generate suitable microhabitats for synanthropic cockroaches,
              helping them to survive and establish with disregard to overall
              climatic restrictions. To test this idea we studied the
              distribution of pest cockroaches spanning the length of Chilean
              territory. Chile, along its 4270 km length north to south extent,
              is a country offering a formidable sampling of Earth's climatic
              diversity accompanied by dense urbanizations. We studied
              entomological collections and spatially analyzed pest cockroach
              distribution found in Chile and discovered that synanthropic
              cockroach populations are consistently concentrated near most

              temperature. Furthermore, health-concern pest cockroach species
              were widely distributed in Chilean territory, found even in its
              most southern urban centers as well as Easter Island. Therefore,
              these disease vectors could exist even in isolated and extreme
              climatic zones as long as urbanization provides the adequate
              microhabitat. We discuss the need for further research in order
              to assess if these distributions can be extrapolated to the

              stimulus. We investigated the behaviour of individual larvae in
              an olfactory test, alone and in groups. Using mixed groups of
              responsive and nonresponsive larvae, we showed that, although
              larvae behaved as individuals, the strength of their responses
              was affected by the presence of other larvae. This effect was
              apparently due to larvae bumping into each other, which reduced
              the distance they travel in the test. Larval olfactory responses
              were not affected by starvation: there were no significant
              differences in the responses of starved and not-starved larvae up
              to a duration of 5h without food. However, food deprivation did
              significantly affect the movement of larvae, with more starved
              larvae leaving the start zone. We found significant differences
              in the olfactory responses of maggots of different ages, with
              responses increasing in strength with increased age but declining
              at the oldest age tested (late third instar). Finally, we found
              evidence that suggests that larvae may show a circadian
              modulation of the strength of their olfactory response, with a
              significant increase over the light:dark cycle. This response was
              maintained when wild-type larvae were shifted to continuous
              darkness but not in arrhythmic period0 mutant larvae. We

               responses of two species of mosquito larvae to a common
               predator, the freshwater bug Notonecta undulata. One prey
               species, Culex pipiens, commonly co---occurs with Notonecta,
               whereas the other, Aedes aegypti, shares no evolutionary history
               with this predator. I tested the evolution---based prediction
               that Culex should be killed at a lower rate due to stronger and
               more precise antipredator responses. I then studied the types of
               cues used by these prey to gauge predation risk by examining
               prey responses to simple disturbances and to potential chemical
               cues associated with predation. The results were that (1) both
               mosquito species responded to Notonecta by moving less and by
               shifting their microhabitat use; (2) Culex was indeed killed at
               a lower rate; (3) Culex showed far stronger responses to
               notonectids; (4) the response of Culex was correlated with
               actual predation risk even after encounter rate with predators
               was accounted for; and (5) Culex, but not Aedes, responded to
               water in which conspecifics had been preyed upon by Notonecta.
               The differences in the responses of the two species can be
               explained by a fundamental difference in the way in which they
               estimate predation risk. Whereas the behavior of Aedes can be
               understood as a response to disturbance per se, Culex behavior
               is also mediated by chemical cues associated with the actual
               predation act. Since more predation on Culex should produce more
               alarm chemical, this cue is probably responsible for the
               observed ``precise'' (i.e., correlated with risk) responses.",

              states dominate larval behavior: wriggling, two distinct types of

              along the bottom of the container (substrate browsing), and
              stationary filter feeding while suspended from the surface film.
              Fed larvae respond to paroxetine with increased wriggling, and
              reductions in both feeding behaviors. In contrast, food-deprived
              larvae treated with paroxetine show no change in the proportion

              filter feeding to substrate browsing. Thus, actions of paroxetine

              stimulation of wriggling, whereas paroxetine causes food-deprived

              effect on the swimming velocity during either wriggling or
              substrate browsing. These data suggest that: (1) serotonergic
              pathways may trigger shifts between distinct behaviors by actions
              on higher level (brain) integrating centers where behaviors such
              as feeding and locomotion are coordinated; (2) these centers in
              fed and food-deprived larvae respond differently to serotonergic
              stimulation suggesting sensory feedback from feeding status; and
              (3) serotonergic pathways also modulate central pattern
              generators of the nerve cord where the bursts of action
              potentials originate that drive the rhythmic muscle contractions
              of wriggling.",

              Aedes aegypti (L.) was monitored using human-bait during
              January-August 1999. Hourly light intensities were measured both
              indoors and outdoors at both urban and rural sites. The
              periodicity of females was diurnal and nocturnal, with 90\%
              arriving during daylight and twilight and 10\% during the night.
              The pattern of landing was trimodal, with consistent peaks at
              0700 h, 1100 h and 1700 h. The diel periodicities at indoor and
              outdoor urban sites were virtually identical. In contrast, the
              periodicities in rural areas differed, with no nocturnal
              activities being recorded at indoor and outdoor sites. At both
              urban and rural sites, larger numbers of adults were collected
              outside than inside houses. A significant correlation between
              light intensities and mosquito landing patterns was observed. The

              with a higher risk of predation were identified, and prey
              behavioural responses were tested in either the physical presence
              of predators or in water containing predation cues. Larvae that
              thrashed on container bottoms had a higher risk of being captured
              by fourth instar C. appendiculata than did larvae resting on the
              water surface. Ochlerotatus triseriatus, but not A. albopictus,
              adopted low-risk behaviours in response to water-borne cues to
              predation. Both prey species reduced risky behaviours in the
              physical presence of the predator, but O. triseriatus showed a
              stronger response.The vulnerability of 2nd and 3rd instar prey to
              predation was compared, and behavioural responses were correlated
              with prey vulnerability. Second instars of both species were more
              vulnerable to predation by C. appendiculata than were 3rd
              instars, and the 3rd instar A. albopictus was more vulnerable

              triseriatus showed a similar reduction of risky behaviours in
              response to the presence of C. appendiculata despite 4th instar
              prey being relatively invulnerable to size-selective
              predation.Weaker predator avoidance, coupled with superior
              competitive ability, of invasive A. albopictus is likely to
              contribute to its coexistence with O. triseriatus in containers

  author   = "Dennis, Emily Jane and Vosshall, Leslie B",
  abstract = "DEET (N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) is the most effective and
              broadly used insect repellent, but its mechanism of action is
              both complex and controversial. Previous work demonstrated that
              DEET acts both on insect smell and taste systems. Its olfactory
              mode of action requires the odorant co-receptor orco, while its
              gustatory repellency is mediated by activation of bitter taste
              receptors and neurons in the proboscis upon ingestion. Together,
              these data have led to the assumption that DEET acts only on
              olfactory and gustatory pathways. We previously observed that
              orco mutant female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are strongly
              attracted to humans even in the presence of DEET, but are rapidly
              repelled after contacting DEET-treated skin. To understand the
              basis of this contact chemorepellency, we carried out a series of
              behavioral experiments and discovered that DEET acts in three
              distinct ways: through smell, taste, and contact. DEET and bitter
              tastants are feeding deterrents when ingested, but only DEET is
              capable of mediating contact repellency on human skin. We show
              that the repellent touch of DEET is mediated by the tarsal
              segments of the legs, and not gustatory neurons in the proboscis
              as previously believed. This work establishes mosquito leg
              appendages as the actual sensors of DEET, and highlights the
              existence of an unknown sensory pathway that is independent of
              bitter taste. These results will inform the search for novel
              contact-based insect repellents.",

              is due to several factors, including increased air travel and
